        <h1>Hard disk drive components and how it works</h1>
        <p>
            Most basic hard drives consist of a number of disk platters that are positioned around a spindle inside a sealed chamber. The chamber also includes read-and-write heads and motors. <br>
            The motor is used to spin the platters, which hold the data, at up to 15,000 rotations per minute (a higher rpm number results in faster performance). As the platters spin, a second motor controls the position of the read-and-write heads that magnetically record information to, and read information from, tracks on each platter.

	External HDDs <br>
	Most HDDs are found internally in a computer and work as stated above. However, individuals can also purchase external hard drives. External hard drives can be used to expand the storage capacity, or act as a portable place to back data up to. An external hard drive can connect to a computer or device through a USB 2.0 interface or with eSATA. External hard drives may also have slower data transfer rates compared to internal HDDs.
